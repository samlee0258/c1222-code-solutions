/*
  - define a new function with one parameter students which is an array of objects
  - in the function code block define a new variable assigned to an empty array
  that is gonna hold the names of the students
  - make a for in loop to loop in the array holding objects because we can't go through
  each object like an array that has index numbers
  - inside the for in loop create a new variable named key to hold the object's
  properties
  - in the code block for the for in loop using the key for the object properties'
  we are gonna access the objects and extract the values of the properties
  - then push the values into the empty array with the push method and one argument
  object at key value
  - return the values out of the function
